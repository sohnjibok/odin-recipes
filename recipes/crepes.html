    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Here is a simple but delicious crepe batter which can be made in minutes. It's made from ingredients that everyone has on hand.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon butter (melted)</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</li>
        <li>Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
